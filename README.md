    <h3 align="center">MSCEF: A Novel Multiline Stripe Centerline Extraction Framework based on Deep Learning.</h3>
</p>


## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the pursuit of wheelset wear assessment via 3D reconstruction. In this endeavor, the pivotal aspect involves the extraction of the laser stripe's centerline, which plays a critical role in achieving accurate 3D reconstruction and subsequently influences the precision of the wear evaluation. To address this challenge, we propose MSCEF, a framework designed to facilitate multi-line laser stripe centerline labeling and centerline extraction.
